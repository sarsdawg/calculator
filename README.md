# Calculator
This Java program is a simple arithmetic calculator that utilizes the JavaAppMath class by paalonge located at https://github.com/paalonge/seng560Alonge_1.

# Using the Calculator
This repository includes the source (.java) and binary (.class) files for both the Calculator and JavaAppMath classes.  The Calculator class includes a main method that runs the program in a user interactive mode on the Java terminal.

# Reuse of JavaAppMath
I was able to reuse JavaAppMath with only one minor edit to the source code, which was commenting out the original package name.  In this regard, it was relatively easy to use.  However, I did add a significant amount of error checking and type conversion to my code in Calculator.java to get it to work seamlessly.

# Description of Calculator.java

##    main 
      The main method runs a continual loop that lets the user choose the operation that she wants to perform.
